## Matrix-Multiplication-Algorithms
1. Iterative Matrix Multiplication Implementation ( Time Complexity : O(n<sup>3</sup>) )
3. Divide and Conquer Matrix Multiplication ( Time Complexity : O(n<sup>3</sup>) )
4. Strassen's Divide and Conquer Matrix Multiplication ( Time Complexity : O(n<sup>2.807</sup>) )


## Test File
- The test file contains all the algorithm implementations in one file
- This done inorder to compare the perfomance of each algorithms in various values of n
